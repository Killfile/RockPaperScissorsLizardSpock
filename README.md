# Rock Paper Scissors (Lizard Spock)

## Background
Is Season Five, Episode 17 of the Big Bang Theory, Sheldon and Barry Kripke are fighting over Professor Rothman's 
office. While the dispute is canonically solved by seeing who can bounce a basketball higher, the first proposed contest
is a friendly game of "Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock."

Let us imagine an alternate reality in which this game determines who wins the office. Since both Sheldon and Kripke 
will only ever pick "Spock," the pair agree to automate the playing of the game and abide by the result. Unfortunately,
they can't find any implementations of RPSLS and the only RPS game on the network is some old Python code Wolowitz 
side-loaded onto his mechanical hand.

## Assignment

Refactor Wolowitz's horrific code into an implementation of Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock, adding appropriate
text outputs to incorporate the additional choices. 

### Focus

This code has lots of duplication and probably a few classes hiding inside it for good measure. Tighten it up as you go
and don't forget to start with some tests.

## Rules for Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock
[Sheldon's explanation is the best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5Q6-wMx-K8) but, if you need it in text format...

```
Scissors cuts Paper

Paper covers Rock

Rock crushes Lizard

Lizard poisons Spock

Spock smashes Scissors

Scissors decapitates Lizard

Lizard eats Paper

Paper disproves Spock

Spock vaporizes Rock

(and as it always has) Rock crushes Scissors
```
